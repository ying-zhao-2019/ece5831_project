Abstract: The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most tragedy in the history. Titanic, named “unsinkable”, sank after colliding with the huge ice mountain. From data collected, there are only 722 from 2224 passengers and crew survived, because of lack of the lifeboats. Many people use machine learning model to predict which kind of passengers could survive during this disaster.  To estimate the survival passenger on the Titanic, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are combined in my project. Comparing with the traditional machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression model, and Naïve Bayes, the results illustrated that RNN-LSTM model has the highest forecasting accuracy.  The main outstanding of this project is to build a deep learning network model using one of the RNN, vanilla LSTM. Using this model, it could fit some other dataset for the further searching. And based on the basic vanilla LSTM, it still can carry out more different models.
